I am a research scientist at the 
[Department of Psychology](https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb06/psychologie?language_sync=1),
 [Justus-Liebig Giessen University](https://www.uni-giessen.de/). 
 
I wonder what makes us different from robots. We're intelligent biological 
animals with an immense imaginative perceptual capability. Machines match this 
intelligence on various isolated functions and I believe, soon, they reach our 
creative perception. That's my research interest. 

I work at this 
multidisciplinary domain of brains, minds and machines aiming to answer how 
complex behaviour arises from neuronal activity. I compare neural networks of 
two organisations: biological versus artificial. 

My focus is visual information 
processing: oscillating in-between psychophysics of visual perception and 
computational modelling of vision.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
